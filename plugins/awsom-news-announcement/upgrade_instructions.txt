4) Go to your Admin Plugins area and activate the new AWSOM News Announcement plugin.
5) You have 2 options at this point: If you previously used the Theme file tag to display your News Announcement and don't want to change
things then turn the option "Place the News Announcement On Index Page above Posts" to off. 
6) OR If you want to remove the now unnecessary Theme edits that version 1.0.2 required go into your theme index.php file

<div id="announcement">
<?php if (function_exists('display_my_news_announcement')) { display_my_news_announcement(); } ?>
</div>

from your theme file. Make sure that you then turn the option "Place the News Announcement On Index Page above Posts" to Yes.
