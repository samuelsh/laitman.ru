AWSOM News Run Php setting Help File

The "Run PHP in News Announcement" setting allows the admin to use active PHP code in the block by entering it in the format: <?php .... ?> 
with the active code in the middle. Now you can use many Wordpress plugins that require a template tag to display (such as video
players, audio players, etc.) in your News Announcement block. Do not leave this setting active if you do not plan on using php code though.
Note: You must use the Code editor to input PHP code, the Visual editor will not allow PHP code to be correctly entered.


If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
