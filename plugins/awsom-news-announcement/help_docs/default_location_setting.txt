AWSOM News Default Location setting Help File

By Default AWSOM News displays it's output on your index page above your posts area. AWSOM News was designed to
minimize the need for the user to directly alter their theme files in order to get a News Announcement area to
appear on their site. This setting turns on or off this behavior for advanced users who would prefer
to place the News Announcement output in an alternate location, or in cases where there are issues
with The News Announcement appearing more than once on the page(see Known Issues help doc). Turn this
setting to "No" to have the News Announcement block only appear in locations where you have placed
the theme code or post/page code. Leave this setting on "Yes" if you want the News Announcement
block to appear in every location including the default one.

The code for placing the News Announcement in a custom location in a theme file is listed
in the Manage AWSOM News admin page. Simply paste this into your theme file where you
want the News Announcement to display. An alternate method of display is to use the AWSOM News
post/page code %%awsomnews0%% to have the News Announcement output appear in a post or page.

Please Note that you may have as many locations active as you'd like using any combination
of theme code, post/page code and Default location and the News Announcement will display
in every location (even multiple pages/posts and theme code locations). Using the New Optional Location system (where a number from 1-8
is placed where the 0 is in the code) allows you to place ONLY specific posts in a location as well as any
posts set to "All Locations".
