AWSOM News Known Issues Help File

During News Post Deletion and Editing, after the process is completed and a confirmation screen is displayed,
the admin page will have a forced refresh after about 5 seconds to clear some data. This is normal and not
a glitch. Navigating away to a different screen before the refresh occurs is ok and will also clear the data.

News Posts that appear in multi-spots on the same page will be counted as viewed based on the number of spots it appears in, not per page.


If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org
