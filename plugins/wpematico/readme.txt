This is for autoblogging. Post automatically from RSS/Atom feeds organized into campaigns. Drinks a coffee meanwhile WPeMatico publishes your posts.

== Description ==

WPeMatico is for autoblogging, automatically creating posts from the RSS/Atom feeds you choose, which are organized into campaigns. 
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9wuKSbp1AE]

Requires PHP >= 5.3

For RSS fetching uses the Simplepie library included in Wordpress or force use of external library.
Also for image processing uses the core functions of wordpress or if fails, tries with custom functions with or without cURL.
